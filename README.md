# 42Guides

Here you can find guides for the projects or libraries of the 42 network. Feel free to add to this or edit any documentation!
This could be a good oppurtunity for you (and me!) to learn how to handle pull requests and it will look good on your github profile to have
contributed to an open source project!

**Will add in the future:** (Anyone else is also welcome to write these)

+ Libft 
+ Compiling on different systems
+ How to cheat norm
+ Clean code
+ Dynamic functions
+ Efficient code
+ Effective organistation
+ So_long (For both MLX42 and Minilibx, my own implementation and standard) 

**No intention of adding myself:** 
+ Born2beroot
+ Minilibx
+ MLX42

## How to go about writing your own guide: 

Follow the same formatting I use or make a case to me why it should be different while submitting your pull request. 
Here is what the structure of my formatting looks like: 
```
# Project name

### Index:
+ [Chapter name](#chapter-name)

## Chapter name
```
If you aren't sure how to write it and don't think you can do so perfectly, that is alright! 
You could just let me know in the comments of your pull request if you specifically want my input on something. 
Or if it is a half finished guide, that is also acceptable. Just add this to your project name: `ðŸ”¨ Under construction`
