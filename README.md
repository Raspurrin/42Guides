# 42Guides

Here you can find guides for the projects or libraries of the 42 network. Feel free to add to this or edit any documentation!
This could be a good oppurtunity for you (and me!) to learn how to handle pull requests and it will look good on your github profile to have
contributed to an open source project!

**Will add in the future:** (Anyone else is also welcome to write these)

+ Libft 
+ Compiling on different systems
+ How to cheat norm
+ Clean code
+ Dynamic functions
+ Efficient code

**Undecided:**
+ So_long

**No intention of adding myself:** 
+ Born2beroot
